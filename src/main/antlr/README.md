# Antlr Parser

The only files that need editing end in `.g4`. The rest are generated by running the following commands on the lexer and the parser:

```$xslt
$ antlr4 KayakLexer.g4
$ antlr4 KayakParser.g4
```

The lexer defines the symbols used in the grammar, while the parser defines the BNF grammar rules. The source is generated in Java.

## To Test:

```$xslt
$ javac Kayak*.java
$ grun Kayak expr -tokens
``` 
Then, enter any valid input - e.g. `10+3`. Hit enter, then hit `ctrl+D`. The grammar will be output. 
You can also see the AST by passing in the -gui flag.
